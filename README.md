# Temperature and Humidity Sensor Monitoring System

## Description:
This project entails the development of a temperature and humidity monitoring system utilizing a DHT11 sensor, interfaced with an Arduino UNO R3 board. The primary objective of this system is to furnish users with a visual alert when temperature and humidity levels surpass predefined thresholds.

## Components:
- Arduino UNO R3 Board
- DHT11 Sensor
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires

## Installation:
1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Connect the DHT11 sensor to the Arduino UNO R3 board using jumper wires.
   - Ensure proper connection of power (VCC), ground (GND), and data (DATA) pins.
   - Place the components on the breadboard for stability.

2. **Software Setup:**
   - Download and install the Arduino IDE.
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Copy the code provided in the `.txt` file into a new sketch in the Arduino IDE.

## Usage:
1. **Upload the Code:**
   - Connect the Arduino UNO R3 board to your computer using a USB cable.
   - Select the appropriate board and port from the Arduino IDE.
   - Click on the upload button to compile and upload the code to the Arduino board.

2. **Monitor Temperature and Humidity:**
   - Once the code is uploaded successfully, the system will start monitoring temperature and humidity levels.
   - If the temperature or humidity exceeds predefined thresholds, a visual warning will be displayed.
